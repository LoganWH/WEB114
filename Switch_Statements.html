  <h1>Switch Statement Example</h1>

  <h2>Question:</h2>
  <p>When would you use a switch statement in your projects?</p>

  <h2>Answer:</h2>
  <p>A switch statement is useful when you have a variable that can take multiple specific values, and you want to execute different code based on which value it is.</p>

  <script>
    // Prompt user for their favorite day
    const favDay = prompt("What is your favorite day of the week? (e.g., Monday, Tuesday)").toLowerCase();

    // this is for the switch statement to display a message
    switch (favDay) {
      case "monday":
        console.log("Mondays Suck");
        break;
      case "tuesday":
        console.log("Tuesdays are for progress");
        break;
      case "wednesday":
        console.log("Wednesdays are halfway there");
        break;
      case "thursday":
        console.log("Thursdays are for focus");
        break;
      case "friday":
        console.log("Fridays are the best");
        break;
      case "saturday":
        console.log("Saturdays are for fun");
        break;
      case "sunday":
        console.log("Sundays are for rest");
        break;
      default:
        console.log("That's an interesting day");
        break;
    }
  </script>
